'The area is a rectangle with dimensions 4.36 x 3.29 x 2.13.0 lights are distributed uniformly in the arena. There are 7 robots placed uniformly around the center within a radius of 1.21 meters. The objective for the swarm is to cover an area of 1.61 by 0.95, while staying connected to each other. The swarm counts as connected if every robot is transitively connected to each other robot in the swarm. Two robots are connected if their distance is at or below 0.11 m. '
