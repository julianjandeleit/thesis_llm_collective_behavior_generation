"The circular arena, having a radius of 2.90 meters, is constructed with 18 walls. The first light is located at (0.36, 1.33), guiding foragers, while the second light is at (0.35, 1.71), providing additional visibility for the other circle.Placed within a 1.91-meter radius around the center are 24 robots. Two circles are presentâ€”one at [0.36, 1.33] with a radius of 0.51 meters, colored in black, and another at [0.35, 1.71] with a radius of 0.31 meters in white. The robots' task is to transport items from the white starting area to the black circle. "
