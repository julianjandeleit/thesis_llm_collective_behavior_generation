'The circular arena, constructed with 19 walls, has a radius of 3.17 m. The following lights are present in the arena at coordinates: ((-0.36, 0.14)).Evenly positioned around the origin are 14 robots within a radius of 1.20 meters. The goal is for the robots to aggregate at the black circle. There are two areas on the floor: a circle at [-1.47, 1.91] with a radius of 0.53 meters in white, and another circle at [-0.36, 0.14] with a radius of 1.03 meters in black. '
