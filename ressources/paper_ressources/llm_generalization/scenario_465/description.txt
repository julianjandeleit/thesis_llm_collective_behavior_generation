A rectangular area, with a length of 4.11 meters, width of 5.52 meters, and height of 1.29 meters, is established.1 lights illuminate the space, located at: ((-0.33, 0.43)).14 robots are evenly distributed around the origin within a radius of 1.87 m. The objective is for the robots to aggregate at the black circle. There are two designated areas on the floor: a circle at [-2.19, -1.28] in white, and another circle at [-0.33, 0.43] in black.
